Week 1 Milestone
===================

Workspace

* Our working tool will be Google Chrome, with AngularJS Batarang developer extension.
* Our project will be saved on [GitHub](http://github.com/) repository, I've to add your users as project collaborators.
 * Setup git: `git config remote.origin.push HEAD`.
 * Git commands: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`.
* We use [c9.io](http://c9.io/) as a coding platfform, you must clone our github project from the Dashboard.
* We'll use a [Firebase](http://firebase.com/) Database and hosting, you'll have to create a Firebase account and then build a local working __angularfire-seed__ instance of your app (I'll explain, no worries).
 * Firebase commands: `sudo firebase bootstrap`, `sudo firebase deploy`.
* Our project will be based on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for quick style markup.
* We'll start with simple html page, pointing to the libraries we'll use, create a folder with your __GitHub username__ and copy `/isorna/app-index.html` inside it.
